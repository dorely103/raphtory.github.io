## FAQ

**1. Which IDE should I use?**    

Since Raphtory is built with Scala, it is best to use IntelliJ IDE for the code. They have a community version which is free. Follow their guide for installation.

**2. What should I do if I get error messages indicating failure to ingest data?**    

Here are a few things to check if you are getting error messages:  

- Check if your files are in the right directory. The latest release of Raphtory, raphtory.jar, should be inside the lib directory.  

- The data source is too big or too many states are being generated in the analysis. Try testing on a smaller sample of the data set.
